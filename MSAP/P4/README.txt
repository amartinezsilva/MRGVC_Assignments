SECTION 1 COMMENT:

We have had to correct one error from area.cpp

SECTION 2 COMMENT:

The scene selected is formed by five similar diamonds made with blender and implemented as dielectric. 
In this scene we can see different reflections of light depending on the position.

There are three different renders of the scene in the section 2, one with path, another with nee and 
a final one with mis. The mis is the best render.
